            "Did you know that by the year 2020, one in five drivers will be age 65 or over? There are many Senior Citizens who are safe drivers, but age does have a tendency to slow all of us down a little. Leaving plenty of space between vehicles is important for all drivers, but it's a good idea for older motorists to give themselves a little extra room, since reaction time can slow with age. It's also smart to allow plenty of time to reach your destination, and plan a route that avoids high-traffic or high-speed areas during rush hour. Vision tends to slip a little too, so wear glasses to drive if you need to. Several organizations, including triple-A and AARP offer defensive driving courses designed especially for drivers over fifty-five. This message was sponsered by the Texas Department of Transportation and the Texas Department of Public Safety."

        "It's night time in a kitchen just like yours; all is quiet, or is it? The North American house hippo is found throughout Canada and the Eastern United States. House hippos are very timid creatures and they are rarely seen, but they will defend their territory if provoked. They come out at night to search for food, water, and materials for their nests. The favourite foods of the house hippo are chips, raisins and the crumbs from peanut butter on toast. They build their nests in bedroom closets using lost mittens, dryer lint and bits of string. The nests have to be very soft and warm; house hippos sleep about 16 hours a day. ... That sounded really real, but you knew it couldn't be true, didn't you? That's why it's good to think about what you're watching on TV, and ask questions, kind of like you just did. A message from Concerned Children's Advertisers."

        "The practice of dressing up in costumes and begging door to door for treats on holidays dates back to the Middle Ages. Trick-or-treating resembles the late medieval practice of souling, when poor folk would go door to door on Hallowmas, November 1st, receiving food in return for prayers for the dead on All Souls Day, November 2nd. It originated in Ireland and Britain, although similar practices for the souls of the dead were found as far south as Italy.",
        "Children of the St. Louis, Missouri area are expected to perform a joke, usually a simple Halloween-themed pun or riddle, before receiving any candy; this 'trick' earns the 'treat'. Children in De-moin, Iowa also tell jokes or otherwise perform before receiving their treat. De-moin trick-or-treating is also unusual in that it is actually done the night before Halloween, known locally as 'Beggars' Night'.",
        "In Scotland and Ireland, trick-or-treating is traditionally called 'guising'. Children receive a gift in the form of food, coins, apples, nuts, or more recently, chocolate. Among the earliest record of guising at Halloween in Scotland is in 1895, where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips visit homes to be rewarded with cakes, fruit and, money."
